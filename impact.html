           <h1> How does fast fashion impact the environment? </h1>

           <p>
             As explained throughout the website, fast fashion is cheaply made and priced clothing that keep up with trends popularized by celebrities and runways. The term “fast fashion” was popularized in the 90s by the well known brand, Zara. Zara released a mission saying it would only take 15 days from when a garment goes into production to being on the sales floor. While this sounds great to a consumer, it creates issues within the environment. According to Business Insider, fashion production makes up 10% of humanity’s carbon emissions, dries up water sources and pollutes river and streams.”
             As for the actual effects that fast fashion industry has on the environment, one of the biggest impacts is water sources. According to Earth Org, the fashion industry is the second largest consumer of water, using around 700 gallons to produce one cotton shirt and 2,000 gallons for one pair of jeans. After being used in the production process, leftover dyes and water is dumped into ditches, streams and rivers.
Microplastics is another harsh effect on the environment. Now more than ever, brands use synthetic fibers-- are man- made fibers like polyester, nylon and acrylic. According to The True Cost, the world consumes about 80 billion new pieces of clothing a year. This averages to 400% more than the consumption twenty years ago. This is harmful to the environment because the chemicals that are used in these fibers is not biodegradable and also contaminates those water sources.
Overall, fast fashion has a toxic impact on the environment. It is better to buy from brands that resell or refurbish their clothing, only make a certain amount or even brands that do pre-orders to make sure they are not making too much of any product. It is important to educate yourself and others on the impacts of the fashion industry.
