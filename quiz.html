             Now that you know that you know the impacts of fast fashion on the environment, here are ways you can reduce your impact.

         <ul style="line-height:1.4">
           <li>Buy Less</li>
            <img class="noshopping" src="noshopping.jpg" alt="A orange and pink shopping bag being held by a hand. A large X is over the top of the bags." width=200px

              While buying clothes is exciting, it creates a large waste problem. As mentioned, fast fashion clothing is poor quality and does not last long. This becomes a problem since people will end up throwing out the clothing faster than they would if buying better quality items. When buying new clothing in the future, it is worth the money to invest in higher quality items so they will last longer.
            </p>
           <li>Shop sustainable.</li>
           <img class="sus" src="sus.png" alt="green reduce, reuse, recycle sign. A leaf is in place of one of the arrows." width=200px
