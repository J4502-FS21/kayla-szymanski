             Now that you know that you know the impacts of fast fashion on the environment, here are ways you can reduce your impact.

         <ul style="line-height:1.4">
           <li>Buy Less</li>
            <img class="noshopping" src="noshopping.jpg" alt="A orange and pink shopping bag being held by a hand. A large X is over the top of the bags. ">

            <p align="left">
              While buying clothes is exciting, it creates a large waste problem. As mentioned, fast fashion clothing is poor quality and does not last long. This becomes a problem since people will end up throwing out the clothing faster than they would if buying better quality items. When buying new clothing in the future, it is worth the money to invest in higher quality items so they will last longer.
            </p>
           <li>Short turnaround time from runway to the sales floor.</li>
           <li>Many of the brands have offshore menufacturers because they are cheaper. In these factories the employees don't get paid much and work long hours.</li>
           <li>Super cheap, low quality textiles like polyester. Using textiles like this causes the clothing to fall apart after onyl a few wears.</li>
         </ul>
                </div>
